Sure! Let me explain the binary addition trick shown in your image step-by-step:

---

### 🔢 **Binary Addition Section (Top Part of the Page)**

You’re adding **4 binary numbers**:

```
  110111   (55 in decimal)
+ 101101   (45 in decimal)
+ 111111   (63 in decimal)
+ 101101   (45 in decimal)
---------
10000000   (128 in decimal)
```

---

### ✅ **Explanation:**

1. **Align All Numbers**:

   ```
   Carry →       0 0 0 0 0 0 0
               110111
               101101
               111111
             + 101101
             ----------
   ```

2. **Column-wise Addition from Right to Left:**
   Start adding bits just like decimal addition, but using binary rules:
   - `0 + 1 = 1`
   - `1 + 1 = 10` (which is 0 with a carry of 1)
   - `1 + 1 + 1 = 11` (which is 1 with a carry of 1)
   - `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 100` (which is 0 with a carry of 2 → propagate carry)

3. After adding all, you get `10000000` (which is 128 in decimal).

---

### 🧠 What’s the Trick Here?

When adding multiple binary numbers:

- If **sum at any column ≥ 2**, you carry over to the next.
- Use the idea: `sum % 2 = result bit`, `carry = floor(sum / 2)`

For example:

- `1 + 1 + 1 = 3`
  - `3 % 2 = 1` → result bit
  - `3 / 2 = 1` (floor) → carry

- You can keep adding carry to the next column as you would in decimal.

### ⚡️ Binary Addition Shortcut (Mental Math Style)

Let’s say you're adding:

```
110111
101101
111111
101101
```

#### 🧠 Step-by-Step Shortcut:

1. **Convert each binary number to decimal** (fast if you know powers of 2):
   - `110111` → **55**
   - `101101` → **45**
   - `111111` → **63**
   - `101101` → **45**

2. **Add them in decimal**:

   ```
   55 + 45 = 100
   100 + 63 = 163
   163 + 45 = **208**
   ```

3. **Convert 208 back to binary**:

   ```
   208 ÷ 2 = 104 R0
   104 ÷ 2 = 52  R0
   52 ÷ 2  = 26  R0
   26 ÷ 2  = 13  R0
   13 ÷ 2  = 6   R1
   6 ÷ 2   = 3   R0
   3 ÷ 2   = 1   R1
   1 ÷ 2   = 0   R1
   → Binary: **11010000**
   ```

✅ You now have the answer without doing column-wise carry.

| 3. Convert result → binary  | Use divide-by-2 shortcut                |

### 📸 **Your Trick from the Image (Top part):**

```
Carry →         0
             110111
             101101
             111111
           + 101101
          ----------
             10000000
```

### ⚡ What’s Happening Here?

You're adding **four binary numbers**, and the trick is:

> ✅ **Whenever a column sum reaches 4 (in decimal), it triggers 3 steps:**
>
> 1. Convert 4 to binary: `100`
> 2. That means `carry = 1` to the next left column
> 3. Final result = place a 0 in current column and propagate

In Bengali from your image:

> **"৪ বা তার বেশি হলেই ০ বসাও, ১ carry যাও, ৩-step হয়"**

Translated:
“If column total is 4 or more → put 0, carry 1, 3 steps happen”

### 🔁 Column Addition Breakdown

Let's analyze **column-by-column** from right to left (just like decimal addition), tracking how many 1s you get:

| Column #        | Bits being added          | Count of 1s | Action                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| 1 (rightmost)   | 1 + 1 + 1 + 1             | 4           | `4 = 100` → write `0`, carry `1` |
| 2               | 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 (carry) | 3           | `3 = 11` → write `1`, carry `1`  |
| 3               | 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (carry) | 5           | `5 = 101` → write `1`, carry `1` |
| 4               | 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 (carry) | 3           | `3 = 11` → write `1`, carry `1`  |
| 5               | 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 (carry) | 4           | `4 = 100` → write `0`, carry `1` |
| 6               | 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 (carry) | 5           | `5 = 101` → write `1`, carry `1` |
| 7 (final carry) | 1 (carry)                 | 1           | write `1`                        |

Final answer: **`10000000`**

## 🧠 No-Memory Binary Trick for 0–9 (Use 8-4-2-1 Grid)

This is called the **8421 shortcut**, also known as the **binary weight method**.

Just draw this grid in your mind (or on paper once) 👇

| 8   | 4   | 2   | 1   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|     |     |     |     |

Now just **fill in 1s** to add up to the number!

---

### ✅ Examples:

Let’s say you want to convert:

#### 5 → Binary

| 8   | 4   | 2   | 1   |               |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ------------- |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   | → ✅ **0101** |

Because 4 + 1 = 5

---

#### 7 → Binary

| 8   | 4   | 2   | 1   |               |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ------------- |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 1   | → ✅ **0111** |

(4 + 2 + 1 = 7)

---

#### 9 → Binary

| 8   | 4   | 2   | 1   |               |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | ------------- |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | 1   | → ✅ **1001** |

(8 + 1 = 9)

---

## ✅ BONUS: Hand Trick (using 4 fingers)

- Assign fingers:
  Thumb = 8
  Index = 4
  Middle = 2
  Ring = 1

Want to show 6? Raise **Index (4) + Middle (2)** → 6 = 0110

---

But if you forget?
👉 **Just use 8-4-2-1 boxes.**

## 🧠 Binary Column Addition Trick (Using Subtraction from Base)

Let’s say you're adding several `1`s in a column.
Each time the **sum ≥ base (2 in binary)**, you:

- Write a `0` and **carry 1**
- Keep subtracting base (2) to find how many **times you carry**

---

### ✅ Example: Adding 5 ones in a column

```
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5
```

Now apply your trick:

- 5 − 2 = 3 → Carry 1
- 3 − 2 = 1 → Carry 1
- 1 < 2 → Stop (final bit = 1)

### Final:

- Result bit = **1**
- Carries = **2**

So → `5 = 101` in binary
→ You write `1`, and carry `2` steps

---

### 🔁 General Pattern:

| Total 1s | Subtraction Steps (Carry) | Final Binary |
| -------- | ------------------------- | ------------ |
| 2        | 1 carry                   | 10           |
| 3        | 1 carry                   | 11           |
| 4        | 2 carries                 | 100          |
| 5        | 2 carries                 | 101          |
| 6        | 3 carries                 | 110          |

---

### 📌 How to Use in Column Addition:

**Just keep subtracting 2 until ≤1, and count how many times.**

```txt
Sum = 5
→ 5 − 2 = 3 (carry 1)
→ 3 − 2 = 1 (carry 1 more)
→ Stop (bit = 1)
```

You write down the **last remainder**, and carry as many times as you subtracted 2.

### ✅ One-Line Rule:

> "Keep subtracting 2 from sum, each subtraction is a carry. When remainder < 2, that’s your result bit."

Perfect! Let’s try a full example using the **division & modulo trick** to add multiple binary numbers column by column.

---

### 🧪 Example: Add these 5 binary numbers

```
  1101
+ 1111
+ 1011
+ 0110
+ 1001
```

Let’s stack them for clarity:

```
   1  1  0  1
 + 1  1  1  1
 + 1  0  1  1
 + 0  1  1  0
 + 1  0  0  1
 ----------------
```

We’ll go **column by column**, from **right to left**:

---

### 📍 Column 4 (rightmost):

Bits: `1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 4`

→ `bit = 4 % 2 = 0`
→ `carry = 4 / 2 = 2`

✅ Write `0`, carry `2` to next column

---

### 📍 Column 3:

Bits: `0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3`
Add carry `2` → total `5`

→ `bit = 5 % 2 = 1`
→ `carry = 5 // 2 = 2`

✅ Write `1`, carry `2`

---

### 📍 Column 2:

Bits: `1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 3`
Add carry `2` → total `5`

→ `bit = 1`, carry = 2

✅ Write `1`, carry `2`

---

### 📍 Column 1 (leftmost):

Bits: `1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 4`
Add carry `2` → total `6`

→ `bit = 6 % 2 = 0`
→ `carry = 3`

✅ Write `0`, carry `3`

---

### 🧮 Final step: Add remaining carry (3) as new left bits

`carry = 3 = 11 in binary`

So we write:

```
  11 0 1 1 0
```

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

```
110110
```

Which is **decimal 54**
